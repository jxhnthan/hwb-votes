# Troubleshooting: Render App Still Going to Sleep

## The Problem

Your Render free tier app goes to sleep after **15 minutes of inactivity**, despite having a keep-alive script.

## Why It's Happening

### ‚ùå Common Issues:

1. **Local Script Not Running 24/7**
   - The `keep-alive.py` script only works when YOUR computer is on and running
   - If your computer sleeps, shuts down, or loses internet ‚Üí the script stops
   - **This is the most common issue!**

2. **GitHub Actions Not Enabled**
   - The workflow file exists but might not be pushed to GitHub
   - GitHub Actions only runs if the workflow is in your GitHub repository

3. **Render Takes Time to Wake Up**
   - First request after sleep can take 30-60 seconds
   - If timeout is too short, it might appear to fail

## ‚úÖ Solutions

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Best Solution - 100% Free)

**Status Check:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/jxhnthan/hwb-votes`
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Look for "Keep App Awake" workflow
4. Check if it's running every 5 minutes

**If not running:**
```powershell
# Make sure all files are committed and pushed
git add .github/workflows/keep-alive.yml
git commit -m "Update keep-alive workflow"
git push origin main
```

**How to verify it's working:**
- Go to GitHub ‚Üí Actions tab
- Click on "Keep App Awake" workflow
- You should see runs every 5 minutes
- Click on a run to see the logs
- Both ping steps should show "‚úÖ"

### Option 2: UptimeRobot (Alternative - Also Free)

If GitHub Actions isn't working, use UptimeRobot:

1. **Sign up:** https://uptimerobot.com (free)
2. **Add Monitor:**
   - Monitor Type: HTTP(s)
   - Friendly Name: HWB Votes
   - URL: `https://hwb-votes.onrender.com/api/photos`
   - Monitoring Interval: 5 minutes (free tier)
3. **Save**

That's it! UptimeRobot will ping your app every 5 minutes automatically.

### Option 3: Cron-job.org (Another Alternative)

1. **Sign up:** https://cron-job.org (free)
2. **Create Cronjob:**
   - URL: `https://hwb-votes.onrender.com/api/photos`
   - Schedule: Every 5 minutes
   - Title: Keep HWB Votes Awake
3. **Save**

## How to Test

### Test if your app is sleeping:

1. **Wait 20 minutes** without visiting the site
2. Try to load: `https://hwb-votes.onrender.com`
3. If it takes 30+ seconds to load ‚Üí it was asleep
4. Check again in 5-10 minutes ‚Üí should load instantly

### Test if keep-alive is working:

**Method 1: Check Render logs**
```
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click on your app
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. You should see activity every 5 minutes
```

**Method 2: Monitor response time**
```powershell
# Run this on your computer
while ($true) {
    $time = Measure-Command { Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://hwb-votes.onrender.com/api/photos" -UseBasicParsing }
    Write-Host "Response time: $($time.TotalSeconds) seconds - $(Get-Date)"
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 60
}
```

If response time is consistently under 2 seconds ‚Üí app is staying awake! üéâ
If response time spikes to 30-60 seconds ‚Üí app is waking from sleep üò¥

## Recommended Setup

**Use BOTH for redundancy:**

1. ‚úÖ **GitHub Actions** (primary)
   - Already set up in `.github/workflows/keep-alive.yml`
   - Runs every 5 minutes
   - Free forever

2. ‚úÖ **UptimeRobot** (backup)
   - Also pings every 5 minutes
   - Free forever
   - Sends you alerts if app goes down

This way, if one fails, the other keeps your app awake!

## Important Notes

### About the Local Python Script (`keep-alive.py`)

‚ùå **Don't rely on this** - it only works when:
- Your computer is ON
- The script is running
- You have internet connection
- Your computer doesn't sleep

This is fine for testing but **NOT reliable** for production.

### Why We Removed `exit 1` from Workflow

The old workflow would fail if status wasn't exactly 200. But:
- Initial wake-up can return different codes
- App might return 304 (Not Modified) - which is fine
- Better to log and continue than to fail

### Render Free Tier Limitations

- Sleeps after **15 minutes** of inactivity
- Takes **30-60 seconds** to wake up
- Limited to **750 hours/month** of runtime
- If you need 24/7 uptime, consider upgrading to paid tier ($7/month)

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow is pushed to GitHub
- [ ] GitHub Actions tab shows workflow running every 5 minutes
- [ ] OR UptimeRobot monitor is set up and active
- [ ] Test: Wait 20 minutes, then check if app loads quickly
- [ ] If still sleeping: Check Render logs for incoming requests

## Still Having Issues?

1. Check Render Dashboard ‚Üí Logs
2. Check GitHub Actions ‚Üí Workflow runs
3. Make sure you're on Render's free tier (not starter)
4. Consider upgrading to paid tier for guaranteed uptime
