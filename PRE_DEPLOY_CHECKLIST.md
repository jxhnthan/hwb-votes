## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If you see "Cannot GET /" after deployment:
The server is serving the built client files. Make sure:
- `npm run build` completed successfully
- `client/dist` folder exists
- Server code includes the production static file serving

### If API calls fail:
Check that the client is using the right API URL:
- In development: `http://localhost:3001/api`
- In production: `window.location.origin + '/api'`

### If photos don't persist on Railway:
Railway provides persistent storage by default. If photos disappear:
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify `server/uploads/` folder exists
3. Check file permissions

## ðŸ“Š After Deployment

Test your live app:
1. âœ… Open from your phone

5. âœ… Vote from different devices
6. âœ… Test admin mode
7. âœ… Delete a photo
